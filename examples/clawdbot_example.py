clawdbot_example.py — Canary-LLM integration for Clawdbot / OpenClaw

Drop little_canary/ into your Clawdbot workspace and add this to your
email processing hook. Scans incoming emails before the agent processes them.

Blocked emails go to quarantine for review.
Flagged emails get an advisory prefix so the agent knows to be cautious.
Clean emails pass through normally.

Requirements:
  - Ollama running with a small model (qwen2.5:1.5b recommended)
  - little_canary/ package in your Python path
